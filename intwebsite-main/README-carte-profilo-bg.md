# Animated Carte Profilo Background

This README documents the process, design decisions, and technical steps for creating an animated background featuring "carte profilo" (profile cards) in motion for your website.

## 1. Animated Background

> Please create an animated background for my website with the following specifications:
> - The background color should be `#1e1e1e` (dark gray).
> - Overlay outlined "carte profilo" (profile cards) as rectangles, arranged in vertical columns.
> - Each card should have **24px vertical spacing** from the next card in the same column, and **24px horizontal spacing** between columns.
> - Each column should move slowly: one column moves up, the next moves down, alternating direction.
> - The cards should be simple outlines (use yellow `#FFDD1A` at 50% opacity and white at 18% opacity).
> - The animation should loop smoothly and not distract from the main content.
> - The background should be fixed and not interfere with page interactions (use `pointer-events: none`).

## 2. Design Specifications
- **Background color:** #1e1e1e (dark gray)
- **Profile cards:** Outlined rectangles ("carte profilo") in vertical columns
- **Spacing:**
  - 24px vertical between cards in a column
  - 24px horizontal between columns
- **Outline color:** Yellow (#FFDD1A) at 50% opacity, white at 18% opacity
- **Motion:**
  - Each column moves slowly (alternating up/down)
  - Animation is smooth, subtle, and loops infinitely
- **Non-intrusive:**
  - Background is fixed and does not block page interactions (`pointer-events: none`)

## 3. Execution Steps
1. **Copy the prompt above** and use it with your preferred AI or share it with a developer.
2. **Integrate the generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** into your project as instructed.
3. **Test the background** to ensure it meets the design and motion requirements.
4. **Customize** the number of columns, card size, spacing, or animation speed as needed in the code.
